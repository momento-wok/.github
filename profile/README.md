# Momento
Hello! Momento is a submission for UofTHacks IX (Feb 2022). For more details please see our Devpost here: https://devpost.com/software/momento-ha6inv

## What is Momento?
Momento is a web app that allows users to revisit special moments. Memories are saved as 360Â° panoramic photos along with their location and short description. These memories are accessible on a map and gallery view for users to browse.

## What are these repositories?
`wok` is our main repository, containing our React web app. Wok is supposed to be a short word similar to pan \[continued below...\].

`pan` is a repository with the React 360 app for the panoramic view. This app is embedded in our main app in `wok`. Pan is short for panoramic, and since pots and woks go with pans, we decided to name our first repository `wok`.

For the record, we are aware these are not very descriptive repository names.
